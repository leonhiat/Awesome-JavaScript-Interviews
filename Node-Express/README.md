### Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

### Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.


Both Chrome browser's JavaScript and Node.js run on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine. This engine takes your JavaScript code and converts it into a faster machine code. Machine code is low level code which the computer can run without needing to first interpret it.
 Firefox uses Mozilla’s SpiderMonkey JS engine, and Microsoft products use its Chakra engine.
