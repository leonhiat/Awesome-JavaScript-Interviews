## IIFE
  * Immediately-invoked function expressions.
  * A design pattern used by most popular libraries to place all library code inside of a local scope.
  * No global property is created for the function (anonymous function expression).
  * All of the properties created inside of the function expression are scoped locally.
  * Encapsulation, preserve the global namespace as any variables declared within the function body will be local to the closure but will still live throughout runtime.

  * Benefits:
    * Local scoping.
