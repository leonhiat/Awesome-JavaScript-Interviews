# Built-in Types
JavaScript defines seven built-in types, which can be broken down into two categories: `Primitive Type` and `Object`.

There are six primitive types: `null`, `undefined`, `boolean`, `number`, `string` and `symbol `.

In JavaScript, there are no true integers, all numbers are implemented in double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754. When we use binary floating-point numbers, it will have some side effects. Here is an example of these side effects.

```js
0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3 // false
```

For the primitive data types, when we use literals to initialize a variable, the variable only has the literals as its value, it doesnâ€™t have a type. It will be converted to the corresponding type only when necessary.

```js
let a = 111 // only literals, not a number
a.toString() // converted to object when necessary
```

Object is a reference type. We will encouter problems about shallow copy and deep copy when using it.

```js
let a = { name: 'FE' }
let b = a
b.name = 'EF'
console.log(a.name) // EF
```
