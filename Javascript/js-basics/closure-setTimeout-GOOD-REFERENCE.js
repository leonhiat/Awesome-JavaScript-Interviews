/* Definition of Closure - A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables. In other words, a function defined and invoked inside another function is called closure. The closure has three scopes, all part of the same chain: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function's variables, and it has access to the global variables
The inner function has access not only to the outer functionâ€™s variables, but also to the outer function's parameters.

Explanation - of above output from setTimeout()
The setTimeout function creates a function (the closure) that has access to its outer scope, which is the loop that contains the index i. After 1 second go by, the function is executed and it prints out the value of i, which at the end of the loop is at 4 because it cycles through 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and the loop finally stops at 4. And arr[4] does not exist, which is why you get undefined.

//SOLUTION - 1 - To print all number from 0..4 after 1000 ms

// const arr1 = [10, 12, 15, 21];

// for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
//   // using the ES6 let syntax, it creates a new binding
//   // every single time the function is called
//   // read more here: http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_variables.html#sec_let-const-loop-heads

//   setTimeout(() => {
//     console.log('The index of this number is: ' + i);

// SOLUTION - 2 - To print all number from 0..4 after 1000 ms

const arr2 = [10, 12, 15, 21];

for (var i = 1; i <= arr2.length; i++ ) {

  // pass in the variable i so that each function
  // has access to the correct index

  setTimeout(function(i_local) {
    return function() {
      console.log('The index of this number is ' + i_local);
    }
  }(i), i * 1000)
