### Question. For which value of `x` the results of the following statements are not the same?

```javascript
if( x <= 100 ) {...}
if( !(x > 100) ) {...}
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

`NaN <= 100` is `false` and `NaN > 100` is also `false`, so if the
value of `x` is `NaN`, the statements are not the same.

The same holds true for any value of x that being converted to type Number, returns `NaN`, e.g.: `undefined`, `[1,2,5]`, `{a:22}` , etc.

This is why you need to pay attention when you deal with numeric variables. `NaN` canâ€™t be equal, less than or more than any other numeric value, so the only reliable way to check if the value is `NaN`, is to use the `isNaN()` function.
