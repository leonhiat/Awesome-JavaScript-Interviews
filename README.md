# Awesome JavaScript Interviews

A collection of super-popular Interview questions, along with answers, and some code-snippets that I was putting together for myself while preparing for JavaScript interviews. Many of these questions are what I have actually faced in real interview. It is by no means comprehensive, and the answers are relatively short ( and for each of the concepts, there are probably better and/or more in depth coverage in the web), but I see this repo as reference tool, so I can continue a technical talk with the interviewer for two to three hours.

There are many fantastic resources for JavaScript interview questions, videos, and blog posts on the web and that I have drawn from. I will cite as many as I can throughout so that additional information on each list item can be easily found.

### Key Fundamental concepts list, before you go for that Front End Engineering Interview

Frontend/UI Engineer Interviews:

1. call, apply and bind method
2. Polyfill for bind method
3. Currying
4. Debouncing
5. async vs defer
6. Event Bubbling & Capturing
7. Prototype & Prototypal Inheritance
8. Throttling
9. Thinking Recursively
10. Local Storage and Session Storage
11. CORS
12. sum(a)(b)(c)...(n)
13. Web Storage APIs
14. Event Loop
15. Web Sockets
16. Closures
17. Callbacks & Promises
18. Revise everything again
19. Difference between deep clone and shallow clone and how to write your own deep clone fucntion/polyfill for deepclone
20. ES6 data structures such as Map and Set. In certain cases, Map is much better suited than an Object. Probably even Server Sent Events would be a good thing to know.
21. Observable and subscribers, subject, behaviour subject and repeatable subject
