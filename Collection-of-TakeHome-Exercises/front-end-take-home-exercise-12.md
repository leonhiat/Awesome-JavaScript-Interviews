# Welcome Frontend Product Exercise

```
TIMEBOX:    2-3 hours max. We mean it!
LANGUAGES:  Javascript
FRAMEWORKS: React and any libraries you want
TESTS:      nice to have, but not mandatory
DOCS:       nice to have, but not mandatory
```

# Overview

This exercise is to implement the best possible solution to one of the exercises below in the time alloted. We're evaluating your ability to take a set of requirements and spike a holistic solution that demonstrates craftsmanship, thoughtfulness and attention to user experience. This is **NOT** a test of how well you know React or ES7+, nor should you try to impress us with overly clever and obtuse solutions. If you want to impress us, build something that is beautiful, intuitive and easy to debug/test/extend :smiley: .

Ideally your solution would have some way to run locally and visualize the results in a browser so we can fully analyze the experience and not just the source code.

# Choose One Of the following

---

## Exercise A: Creating an offer

### As a hiring manager I want to

- Create a a new offer of employement
  - Specify the monetary compensation details of an offer (salary, equity, bonus, etc)
  - Specify non-monetary compensation and benefits (culture, learning opportunities, etc)
- See a list of the offers I've created
- Share a link to an offer via a unique URL

### As an employee receiving an offer I want to

- View an offer that was sent to me
  - **stretch goal**: Ask a question about the offer (ideally a subsection of the offer)
- Understand the non-salary compensation I am being offered (stock valuation, value of healthcare benefits)
- See detail about the role, team, and organization

## Exercise B: Visualizing Compensation and Benefits

### As a HR-team member I want to

- "Upload" a CSV/JSON file with my the compensation data of my current organization
  - **NOTE**: You don't need to create an API around file storage/IO. Use any/all of the sample files in [/shared/salary_datasets](/shared/salary_datasets) or create your own simple faked data set.
- View the data in a simple tabular view
  - **stretch goal**: be able to sort or search by any unique identifiers (name, email, etc) so I can find specific rows
- View simple visualization(s) of the distribution of salary compensation so I can get an overview/aggregate of overall compensation
  - **stretch goal**: be able to visualize data across more than one dimension

# Submitting your exercise

Create a new private repository for your exercise and add the our hiring team members as private collaborators (We do this to preserve your anonymity so it's not obvious you are looking for a new tole.)

JohnDoe@gmail.com (Head of Engineering)

Complete as much of the exercise as you can in 3 hours or less. Unless otherwise specified in the instructions.md document, you can use any language, framework, or toolchain you wish, although ideally this would be Python, Javascript (ReactJS), and SQL (purely because those are the languages we use to build Welcome and will be the most familiar with)

Be sure to include the following in your submission

- a README.md with the following information
- A few screenshots of the finished product. Show off that work! camera_flash
- The exercise you choose and why
- A short explanation of what you built
- How to test/demo/run (if applicable)
- NOTE: a 'working' exercise is awesome, however it is NOT a hard requirement. We mean it!
- Any feedback/notes (i.e. if something was hard, confusing, frustrating, etc)
- Anything else you'd lke us to know about your submission
- a ROADMAP.md with what you would add/change if you had more time. Dream big.
- a super-simple test suite if applicable (even one test is a bonus)
- Some form of lightweight technical documentation (code comments are fine)
- When complete email a link to the repository and any special instructions to JohnDoe@gmail.com

Sit back and relax. We'll review your submission and get back to you within 48 hours smiley
