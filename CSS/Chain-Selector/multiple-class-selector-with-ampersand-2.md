### & concatenation

Ampersand can also be used to **concatenate** additional class names (or IDs, etc.) into a compound selector for higher priority (instead of adding another descendant selector).

While nesting is the most popular feature of Sass it's also the most abused, as increased specificity means less performant CSS selectors and it's really easy to get carried away.
