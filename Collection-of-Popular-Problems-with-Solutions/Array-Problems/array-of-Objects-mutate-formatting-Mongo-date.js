/* Extremely important for React NOT TO MUTATE THE STATE

FROM BLOG POST - https://medium.freecodecamp.org/handling-state-in-react-four-immutable-approaches-to-consider-d1f5c00249d5

Imagine you have a form for editing a user. Itâ€™s common to create a single change handler to handle changes to all form fields. It may look something like this:


```JS
updateState(event) {
 const {name, value} = event.target;
 let user = this.state.user; // this is a reference, not a copy...
 user[name] = value; // so this mutates state ðŸ™€
 return this.setState({user});
}
```

Iâ€™m using ES6 object shorthand on line 5â€Šâ€”â€Šyou can omit the right-hand side when the left-hand side matches.

The concern is on line 4. Line 4 actually mutates state because the user variable is a reference to state. React state should be treated as immutable.

From the React docs:

Never mutate this.state directly, as calling setState() afterwards may replace the mutation you made. Treat this.state as if it were immutable.
Why?

setState batches work behind the scenes. This means a manual state mutation may be overridden when setState is processed.
If you declare a shouldComponentUpdate method, you canâ€™t use a === equality check inside because the object reference will not change. So the approach above has a potential performance impact as well.
Bottom line: The example above often works okay, but to avoid edge cases, treat state as immutable.
