Question 2 of 56

What will be the result of the following line of JavaScript code?
var result = "a" < 3;
alert(result);
Support your answer with detailed reasoning. Be as explicit as possible.

var result = "a" < 3;
alert(result);

Will output - false

JavaScript defines >= and <= (and several other operators) in a way that allows them to coerce their operands to different types. It's just part of the definition of the operator.

In the case of <, >, <=, and >= check §11.8.5 of the specification.

If both operands are strings (after having been coerced from objects, if necessary), it does a string comparison.

Otherwise, it coerces the operands to numbers and does a numeric comparison.

This works because of typecasting and the fact that NaN < 3 is false.

When applying to the < operator, both operands are cast to Numbers, so that comparison becomes

Number("string") < 3

which is equivalent to NaN < 3 which evaluates to false

var num = -10;
alert(num.toString(2));

Will output >> -1010

The toString() function is used with a number num as shown in above syntax using the ‘.’ operator. This function will convert num to a string.

Parameters Used: This function accepts a single optional parameter base. This parameter specifies the base in which the integer is represented in string. It is an integer between 2 and 36 which is used to specify the base for representing numeric values.
